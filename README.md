## Experience
### Go developer at [G2A](https://www.g2a.com/)
(July 2020 - June 2021)

I'm building the logistic part of the platform. I build Go (micro)services that support purchasing a physical product as well as integrating with external services. One of my challenges was understanding the domain correctly to be able to rewrite the monolith (Magento) application. I had to make sure that, at the first phase, the behavior doesn't change but the new implementation is open to new features and improvements. I modeled the part of the domain I was responsible for.

What's more, I was a member of a team that introduced [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in the company. I prepared a Go library helped developers to migrate to the [new solution](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/open-telemetry-elastic.html).

Technologies I use: Go, Kubernetes, Docker, RabbitMQ, Kafka, ELK

### Go developer at [Brainly](https://brainly.com/)
(May 2018 - July 2020)

I've been working in a team that focused on engaging users to have more interaction with the page. I built several services that support it. One of them was a service that's tracking user's pageviews (similar to Google Analitycs). The value it brought was associating specific page views with concrete users. It gave us the ability to create very targeted campaigns.

Technologies I use: Go, Kubernetes, Docker, RabbitMQ, GraphQL, ELK, AWS
